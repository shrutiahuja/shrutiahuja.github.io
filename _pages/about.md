Hi! I am Shruti Ahuja, a Ph.D. Research Scholar at the Centre for Research in Nanotechnology & Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I am a [Prime Minister's Research Fellow](https://www.pmrf.in/) advised by [Prof. Kiran Kondabagil](https://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/people/faculty/kondabagil-k/) and [Prof. Siddharth Tallur](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/siddharth-tallur/). I have also closely collaborated with [Prof. Richa Pandey](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/richa-pandey) to explore electrochemical sensing parameters for DNA detection.

My research lies at the intersection of molecular diagnostics, wastewater surveillance, and electrochemical sensing to enable low-cost, rapid, field-deployable public-health surveillance systems. I have developed an end-to-end wastewater surveillance workflow from nucleic-acid capture and electrochemical DNA sensing to metagenomics. This work has been recognized nationally, notably being showcased on the PMRF website under [commendable inter-disciplinary research projects](https://www.pmrf.in/10-id-commendable-research-works). Internationally, I received the Best Poster Award at the ICGEB Pandemic Preparedness Conference (Italy) and a competitive bursary to present my work at the Oxford Pandemic Science Conference (UK).

Prior to Ph.D., I was the R&D Lead and founding staff at [Valetude Primus Healthcare](https://www.linkedin.com/company/valetude-primus-healthcare/), a MedTech spin-off from IIT Delhi. I built and led a team of 10+ scientists and engineers while working closely with clinicians and stakeholders to develop affordable, state-of-the-art infectious-disease diagnostics for rural settings. This translational experience strengthened my commitment to finding the simplest practically deployable solutions for real-world health challenges. 

I am currently seeking **postdoctoral opportunities** that leverage my interdisciplinary experience in diagnostics, pathogen surveillance, and policy decision making to drive impactful public health solutions.

## Research Interests

*The research problems that I am currently exploring are:*

- **Paper-based pathogen concentration and nucleic-acid extraction from wastewater**
  - Developed rapid, low-cost paper-based pathogen capture and nucleic acid isolation from sub-millilitre (dipstick) to larger wastewater volumes (PTFE membrane filtration) with minimal preprocessing, achieving recovery comparable to commercial extraction kits without compromising amplification efficiency. Performed temporal surveillance to correlate PMMoV viral load with population density. Successfully detected SARS-CoV-2, *E.coli*, and bacteriophage Phi6.

- **Product validation: Assessing reproducibility of paper-based nucleic-acid extraction for field deployment using multi-operator variability studies**

  - Conducted multi-operator two-way ANOVA and crossed Gage repeatability and reproducibility statistical analysis to ensure that the manual nature of the paper dipstick method had acceptable variability as per industrial standards across users and wastewater samples. 

- **Electrochemical sensing for nucleic-acid detection using Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold (ENIG) PCB electrodes**

  - Developed an ENIG-PCB DNA sensing platform (no cold-chain storage, long shelf life) along with studying the influence of DNA concentration, amplicon length and ionic strength on sensor response. Evaluated practical constraints of using oligonucleotide modified ENIG-PCB electrodes for faradaic EIS measurements and proposed the use of constant phase element (CPE) as an alternative to charge transfer resistance (Rct) as the sensing parameter. 

- **Metagenomic Surveillance (on-going)**

  - Optimizing bacterial concentration and DNA capture using paper dipsticks for 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomic profiling of wastewater samples from residential areas in Mumbai, India.

***The research problems that I wish to explore in the future:***

- Develop point-of-use rapid diagnostics for rapid infectious disease diagnosis.
  
- Pathogen surveillance using next generation sequencing understanding pathogen spillover, metagenomics, variant detection, and AMR profiling across clinical or environmental samples.
  
- Data-driven public-health decision support and policy translation researching and proposing regulatory and ethical guidelines for the implementation of environmental surveillance data in public health policy.
  
I love working on real world-healthcare problems, optimizing and curating bioassays amenable to eventual integration with commercially viable platforms. My experience with [typhoid detection from blood and tuberculosis detection from sputum samples using immunomagnetic cell capture technique](https://shrutiahuja.github.io/industrial-projects/) piqued my interests in affordable diagnostics. I planned to continue my research on detecting bloodstream infections for my Ph.D. research however due to the restrictions on patient sample collections during the COVID-19 pandemic, I diverted my focus on environmental surveillance to create an end-to-end system that could be utilised as an early warning indicator for outbreak monitoring. 


## Additional Interests

I enjoy teaching and mentoring, having been a teaching assistant for several courses at NPTEL (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) and St. Xavier's College, Mumbai including modules in molecular biology. I have also served as the teaching assistant for the LC-MS instrument at IIT Bombay. At the [CY-PHY lab](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~stallur/index.php/), I have mentored several interns training them in real-time quantitative PCR, fluorescence microscopy, plasmid transformation, PAGE. Outside the lab, I am passionate about policy studies developing sustainability policies that can be implemented at the IIT Bombay campus as part of the Team Zero waste club. 

I enjoy tinkering, designing prototypes on CAD softwares and 3D-printing. I love travelling, art and everything to do with nature. Chess and coffee happen to be my happy place :)
