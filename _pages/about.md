Hi! I am Shruti Ahuja, a Ph.D. Research Scholar at the Centre for Research in Nanotechnology & Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I am a [Prime Minister's Research Fellow](https://www.pmrf.in/) advised by [Prof. Kiran Kondabagil](https://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/people/faculty/kondabagil-k/) and [Prof. Siddharth Tallur](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/siddharth-tallur/). I have also closely collaborated with [Prof. Richa Pandey](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/richa-pandey) to explore electrochemical sensing parameters for DNA detection.

My research lies at the intersection of molecular diagnostics, wastewater surveillance, and electrochemical sensing to enable low-cost, rapid, field-deployable public-health surveillance systems. I have developed an end-to-end wastewater surveillance workflow from nucleic-acid capture and electrochemical DNA sensing to metagenomics. This work has been recognized nationally, notably being showcased on the PMRF website under [commendable inter-disciplinary research projects](https://www.pmrf.in/10-id-commendable-research-works). Internationally, I received the Best Poster Award at the ICGEB Pandemic Preparedness Conference (Italy) and a competitive bursary to present my work at the Oxford Pandemic Science Conference (UK).

Prior to Ph.D., I was the R&D Lead and founding staff at [Valetude Primus Healthcare](), a MedTech spin-off from IIT Delhi. I built and led a team of 10+ scientists and engineers and worked closely with clinicians and stakeholders to develop affordable state-of-the-art infectious-disease diagnostics for rural settings. This translational experience strengthened my commitment to finding the simplest practically deployable solutions for real-world health challenges. 

I am currently seeking **postdoctoral opportunities** that leverage my interdisciplinary experience in diagnostics, pathogen surveillance, and policy decision making to drive impactful public health solutions.
