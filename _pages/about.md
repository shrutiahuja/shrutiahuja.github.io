I am a Research Scholar at IIT Bombay developing field-deployable platforms for end-to-end wastewater surveillance. 
My interdisciplinary research bridges molecular biology, biosensing, and metagenomics for pandemic preparedness. 
Prior to my Ph.D., I was the R&D Lead at Valetude Primus Healthcare (IIT Delhi MedTech spin-off), developing affordable 
infectious disease diagnostics for resource-limited settings. I am currently seeking postdoctoral opportunities in 
diagnostics, pathogen surveillance, and policy decision making.
