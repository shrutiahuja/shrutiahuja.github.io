## Objective: 
To develop and evaluate two cost-effective workflows for simultaneous microbial concentration and nucleic-acid extraction from wastewater (a paper dipstick for ~1 mL samples and a PTFE membrane filter with a 3D-printed peristaltic pump for 40 mL samples) and to benchmark their recovery efficiency against a commercial kit.

## Background: 
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated research towards developing low-cost assays for automated urban wastewater monitoring assay that can be integrated into an environmental surveillance system for early warning of frequent disease outbreaks and future pandemics. Microbial concentration is one of the most challenging steps in wastewater surveillance, due to the sample heterogeneity and low pathogen load. Keeping in mind the requirements of large-scale testing in densely populated low- or middle-income countries (LMICs), such assays would need to be low-cost and have rapid turnaround time with high recovery efficiency. In this study, two such methods are presented and evaluated against commercially available kits for pathogen detection in wastewater. The first method utilizes paper dipsticks while the second method comprises of a PTFE membrane filter (PMF) integrated with a peristaltic pump. 

## Methods:
Wastewater samples were collected as per CDC guidelines from a sewage pumping station at IIT Bombay. Two nucleic acid extraction workflows were evaluated. For small-volume (~1 mL) samples, a wax-backed cellulose paper dipstick was used to bind nucleic acids directly from thermally lysed wastewater. The dipstick was immersed sequentially in lysis, wash, and elution steps; nucleic acids were released directly into the RT-PCR reaction mix without further purification. For larger-volume samples (~40 mL), a hydrophilic 0.2 µm PTFE membrane filter mounted on a low-cost 3D-printed peristaltic pump was used to concentrate microbes. After filtration, the membrane was washed and eluted in nuclease free water. Both methods were used to concentrate and isolate nucleic acids from different microbes such as SARS-CoV-2, pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), bacteriophage Phi6, and E. coli from wastewater samples with minimal or no sample pre-processing. Both the methods were validated and benchmarked against the commercially available Qiagen PowerWater Rneasy kit.  

## Results: 
The dipstick protocol successfully captured bacteriophage Phi6, PMMoV and SARS-Cov-2. The qRT-PCR Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 obtained for the dipstick and PMF method  were at par with the Qiagen kit. The PMF method yielded relative recovery efficiencies of roughly 10–40 % for E. coli and PMMoV and ~19 % absolute recovery for Phi6 (compared to ~30 % for the commercial kit in the same tests). 

## Conclusion: 
Both the cellulose dipstick (for small volumes) and the PMF method (for larger volumes) provide low-cost, rapid alternatives for microbial concentration and nucleic-acid extraction suitable for wastewater surveillance in resource-limited settings.
