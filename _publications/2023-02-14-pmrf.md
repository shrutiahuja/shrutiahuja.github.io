**Developed a low-cost electrochemical DNA sensing platform using unmodified ENIG PCB electrodes to detection of viral amplicons for environmental water monitoring in resource-limited settings.**

The highlights of this work are:

1. Demonstrating that electrochemical activity depends on different mechanisms of MB-DNA interaction, DNA concentration and length, with the longer fragment (~500 bp) showing higher sensitivity, despite the negative impact of salt on the electrostatic interactions between MB and DNA.

2. Corroborated that different mechanisms of MB-DNA interaction are at play depending on DNA concentration. At DNA concentrations lower than 2ng/µl, we observed the electrochemical current response to be dominated by adsorption of MB-DNA on the electrode, whereas at higher DNA concentrations, the electrochemical current response is determined by steric inhibition of redox activity due to intercalation of MB between base pairs of DNA.

3.Established the utility of ENIG-PCB electrodes for electrochemical detection of bacteriophage Phi6 (SARS-CoV-2 surrogate) amplicons obtained from water sample from Powai lake on IIT Bombay campus.

4. Low-cost of implementation, with potential for integration into fully-automated surveillance systems.
