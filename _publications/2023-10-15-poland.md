**Designing a paper-dipstick bioassay that can be integrated with a field-portable thermocycler for RNA isolation from wastewater samples.**

This work details the development of a an easy and rapid dipstick-based method for RNA isolation and purification, which alleviates the complexities of existing wastewater surveillance methods. The approach uses a cellulose dipstick that selectively binds nucleic acids directly from a wastewater sample. After a brief wash to remove inhibitors, the captured RNA is released into an amplification mix ready for RT-PCR. No centrifugation, no specialized equipment, and no complicated purification steps. This method was used to successfully isolated Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV), a widely used fecal indicator from wastewater samples as well as spiked SARS-CoV-2 RNA from synthetic wastewater designed to mimic municipal sewage.
