## Objective: 
To introduce methylene blue (MB) as an alternative, label-free signal reporter for nucleic-acid lateral flow assays (NALFAs), enabling direct visual and electrochemical readout without the need for nanoparticle or enzyme conjugation.

## Background: 
Lateral flow assays for nucleic acid detection traditionally rely on gold nanoparticles, fluorophores, or enzymes, which require complex surface functionalization, multi-step bioconjugation, and often increase assay cost. Methylene blue, a redox-active phenothiazine dye, binds nucleic acids through electrostatic attraction and intercalation, making it a promising low-cost, stable, and dual-mode reporting molecule for point-of-use diagnostics.

## Methods:
Hybridization was performed on lateral flow membranes using complementary probe–target oligonucleotide pairs to form stable duplex structures. After hybridization, methylene blue (MB) was introduced as a post-hybridization signal tracer; the dye associates spontaneously with double-stranded and single-stranded nucleic acids through electrostatic attraction and intercalation. Following migration along the membrane, test-line development was evaluated visually and through electrochemical readout to quantify signal intensity, specificity, and background response. Experimental conditions were systematically adjusted to determine the optimal MB concentration that generates a strong hybridization-dependent signal while minimizing non-specific retention of unbound dye.

## Results: 
Methylene blue generated a distinct test-line signal upon hybridization, enabling visual, amplification-free identification of nucleic acid duplexes on the strip without requiring nanoparticle conjugation. The retained MB at the test region was also readily quantified electrochemically, demonstrating dual-mode detection capability within the same assay format. Due to MB’s strong affinity for nucleic acids, the signal contrast between hybridized and non-hybridized regions was high, and minimal handling was required to achieve a measurable response. Optimization of MB concentration reduced non-specific background from free dye, and the assay operated without antibodies, enzymes, or nanomaterials, thereby simplifying the strip design and lowering assay cost.

## Conclusion: 
Methylene blue functions as an effective, low-cost, and easily deployable signal reporter for nucleic-acid lateral flow assays, supporting both visual and electrochemical detection without complex labeling chemistry. This strategy reduces fabrication complexity and supports the development of rapid, field-compatible molecular diagnostic tools.
