## Objective: 
To demonstrate that the constant phase element (CPE) obtained from high-frequency Faradaic EIS can serve as an alternative sensing parameter to charge transfer resistance (Rct) for DNA detection on ENIG PCB electrodes, while avoiding electrode degradation and enabling rapid, reliable measurements.

## Background: 
Electroless nickel immersion gold (ENIG) finish printed circuit board (PCB) substrates offer a cost-effective solution for electrochemical sensing of biomolecules. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is highly sensitive and can differentiate between bioelectrochemical circuit elements over a wide frequency range. Traditional Faradaic EIS measurements often focus on charge transfer resistance to determine analyte concentration. However, the long measurement time required to perform such EIS measurements down to very low frequencies (typically 0.1 Hz) can adversely affect the ENIG PCB due to gold layer degradation and copper corrosion.

## Methods:
ENIG PCB electrodes were biofunctionalized with a thiol-terminated ssDNA probe complementary to the *E.coli* uidA gene (166 bp). Column-purified complementary and non-complementary amplicons (166 bp, 117 bp, 584 bp) were prepared by standard culture, nucleic-acid extraction, cDNA synthesis (for Phi6), PCR amplification, gel purification and dilution (0–50 ng/µL). Denatured single-stranded targets (2 µL) were dropcast onto probe-functionalized electrodes, incubated, rinsed, and measured with Faradaic EIS using 2 mM potassium ferrocyanide as redox probe. EIS spectra were acquired from 10 Hz–100 kHz (31 points) with 10 mV AC amplitude and −0.195 V DC bias; measurements were performed in triplicate on separate electrodes and fitted to a Randles circuit incorporating a CPE to extract Qdl and n. Specificity was assessed using non-complementary amplicons and wastewater-derived unpurified PCR products (E. coli and Phi6). All experiments were performed in triplicate on independently functionalized electrodes.

## Results: 
CPE magnitude (Qdl, normalized) exhibited a concentration-dependent, non-monotonic trend for the complementary 166 bp target: Qdl increased up to ≈10 ng/µL then decreased at higher concentrations (steric hinerance). Non-complementary targets showed no significant change. Bode and Nyquist analyses confirmed capacitive behaviour (n ≈ 0.8–0.9). Operating EIS from 10 Hz upwards reduced scan time from ≈10 min to ≈15 s and avoided observable ENIG degradation that occurs with low-frequency scans. Preliminary wastewater tests showed statistically significant differences between undiluted and ten-fold diluted complementary samples versus NTC for the 166 bp target, supporting feasibility for environmental samples, though electrode-to-electrode variability and calibration against qPCR remain necessary for quantitation.

## Conclusion: 
Measuring the CPE at higher frequencies provides a rapid, sensitive alternative to Rct-based Faradaic EIS on ENIG PCBs, preserving electrode integrity while enabling specific detection of target amplicons (uidA, 166 bp) and preliminary detection from wastewater. The approach reduces measurement time, reveals concentration-dependent CPE behaviour that must be considered for quantification, and is promising for low-cost environmental DNA surveillance pending improvements in electrode reproducibility and calibration against molecular standards.
