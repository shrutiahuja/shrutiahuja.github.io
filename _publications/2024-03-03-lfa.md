## Objective: 
To develop a simple, low-cost paper-fluidic workflow that performs DNA isolation from urine using cellulose dipsticks and enables visual detection of PCR amplicons on an in-house nucleic-acid lateral flow strip for urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostics.

## Background: 
UTIs affect millions worldwide and rapid identification of the causative organism is important for targeted therapy. Lateral flow assays are widely used for point-of-care testing but typically require upstream nucleic-acid purification and amplification. Paper-based dipstick extraction has been reported for several sample types but its application to urine and integration with a NALF readout for UTI targets has not been explored.

## Methods:
Artificial urine diluent was spiked with E. coli at 10³–10⁶ CFU/mL. Thermal lysis was optimized and performed at 60 °C for 10 min. Cellulose dipsticks were used to capture DNA from 1 mL samples, washed, then eluted directly into PCR master mix. A 166-bp fragment of the uidA gene was amplified. NALF strips were fabricated from nitrocellulose and absorbent pads (3.5 mm × 21 mm membranes) with a 20-nt probe UV-crosslinked (150 mJ/cm² for 120 s). Gold-nanoparticle (40 nm) conjugates bearing thiolated probes were prepared (TCEP activation, salt aging) and pre-mixed with denatured amplicons prior to lateral-flow application.

## Results: 
Thermal lysis at 60 °C for 10 min provided effective cell disruption for downstream amplification. The dipstick workflow enabled amplification of the 166-bp uidA target from spiked urine; agarose gels showed bands down to a visually determined limit of detection of 10⁴ CFU/mL. NALF testing with AuNP–probe conjugates produced clear test bands for 10⁵ CFU/mL spiked samples (duplicates shown), with negative controls showing no band. UV/Vis confirmed AuNP–oligo conjugation (≈2 nm plasmon shift).

## Conclusion: 
A paper-fluidic pipeline combining cellulose dipstick extraction and a NALF readout can recover and detect E. coli DNA from urine with minimal equipment. The approach demonstrates promise for low-cost, point-of-care UTI diagnostics and is amenable to further integration (origami folding) and extension to other sample matrices such as wastewater.
