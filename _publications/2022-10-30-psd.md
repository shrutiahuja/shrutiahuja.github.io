## Objective: 
Develop a low-cost and portable DNA sensing method that quantifies PCR amplicons using methylene blue intercalation and a phase-sensitive optical readout, eliminating the need for conventional qPCR systems.

## Background: 
Methylene blue (MB) intercalates within double-stranded DNA, resulting in a measurable change in absorbance. qPCR instruments exploit fluorescence or intercalating dyes to quantify amplification, but the high cost of thermocyclers and optical modules limits accessibility in low-resource settings. Leveraging MB–DNA binding with a simple photodiode-based detector provides a cost-effective alternative for post-PCR quantification.

## Methods:
PCR amplicons were generated from bacteriophage Phi6 using standard RT-PCR. After amplification, samples were mixed with methylene blue (50 µM) and incubated to allow dye intercalation. A custom optical phase-sensitive detector—consisting of an LED, photodiode, and synchronous readout circuitry—measured the change in transmitted light intensity. Calibration was performed using purified amplicons spanning 1–15 ng/µL. Intermediate PCR cycle tubes (5, 10, 20, 30, 35 cycles) were also analyzed to emulate qPCR-style quantification.

## Results: 
A linear response was observed between detector output and DNA concentration (1–15 ng/µL, R² > 0.95). The system distinguished intermediate amplification cycles, showing clear separation between no-template controls and samples from ≥10 PCR cycles. The detector consistently measured changes in absorbance linked to MB–DNA intercalation, demonstrating sensitivity to increasing amplicon yields.

## Conclusion: 
Methylene blue intercalation coupled with phase-sensitive optical detection provides a simple and inexpensive method for post-PCR DNA quantification. This approach reduces reliance on qPCR hardware and offers a practical alternative for nucleic-acid sensing in resource-limited settings.
