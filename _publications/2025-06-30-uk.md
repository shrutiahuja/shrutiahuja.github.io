**A pipeline of pathogen capture, nucleic acid extraction and amplification along with metagenomics using lab developed dipstick and PTFE membrane filtration (PMF) method.**

LMICs face significant challenges in individual clinical diagnostics due to resource constraints and large populations. Wastewater surveillance enables community-level monitoring but is hindered by the lack of accessible, field-deployable sample processing, microbial capture, and nucleic acid extraction methods.

We present a low-cost, instrument-free, paper-dipstick method that enables pathogen detection in resource-limited settings without specialized infrastructure. Using this method, we successfully detected SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV, *E. coli*, and 16S rRNA gene from wastewater, achieving comparable recovery efficiency to commercial kits. A multi-operator gage R&R study validated reproducibility and field applicability. Early results show potential for metagenomics sequencing.

This scalable, decentralized platform is ideal for LMICs, enabling real-time hotspot identification and supporting outbreak preparedness.
