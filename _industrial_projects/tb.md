**The system includes magnetic nanoparticles based capture and enrichment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis followed by a fluorescent read-out.**

Key highlights: 

- Developed and optimized a sputum decontamination and liquefaction workflow to enable efficient binding of magnetic nanoparticle–conjugated antibodies to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

- Collaborated with Jamia Hamdard University for clinical validation on patient sputum samples and benchmarked assay performance against standard smear microscopy.

- Achieved rapid bacterial capture and enrichment, followed by quantification using a fluorescent readout within ~1 hour.

- This technology was awarded the [India Health Fund (IHF) 2018 grant](https://www.tatatrusts.org/media/press-releases/india-health-fund-announces-winners-of-its-rfp-2-0#:~:text=12%20November%2C%202018,and%20improving%20adherence%20to%20drugs.) for innovative TB detection platforms.
