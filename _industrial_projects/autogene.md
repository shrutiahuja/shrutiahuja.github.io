**AutoGene is a rapid COVID-19 diagnostic platform developed during the early phase of the pandemic.**

The system includes magnetic nanoparticles based capture and enrichment of viral RNA followed by a fluorescent end-point readout of the amplified product.

Key highlights: 

- Developed a silica-coated magnetic nanoparticle system to capture and enrich viral RNA directly from nasopharyngeal swab samples, eliminating the need for elaborate extraction workflows.

- Built an easy-to-use RT-PCR assay with a fluorescent end-point readout, achieving a total turnaround time of ~3 hours from sample to result.

- The platform reached to the **Semi-finals of the International X-Prize Rapid COVID Testing Competition (2020)**, representing one of the top global entries among teams from 35 countries.
