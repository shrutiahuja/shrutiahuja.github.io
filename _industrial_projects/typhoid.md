venue: Valetude Primus Healthcare, IIT Delhi
permalink: /industrial-projects/typhoid/
excerpt: "Developed and optimized an immuno-magnetic platform (iMC²/iAST) for rapid typhoid detection directly from blood samples, achieving 10 CFU/mL sensitivity and reducing diagnostic time from days to hours. Translated the assay toward commercial readiness through selective growth optimization, magnetic capture using Vi-antibody–coated nanoparticles, and development of a proprietary blood-liquefaction medium."

**The system includes immuno-magnetic platform followed by a novel viability testing platform with afluorescent read-out.**

Key highlights: 

- Developed a point-of-care magnetic cell-capture platform for detecting *Salmonella typhi* from blood samples. Optimized the bioassay and translated the research towards commercial readiness. 

- Addressed major bottlenecks in blood processing by developing a proprietary nutrient medium that liquefies blood while enabling selective growth and enrichment of *S.typhi*.
  
- Optimized capture of *S.typhi* using magnetic nanoparticles conjugated with target monoclonal antibodies.

-  Achieved 10 CFU/mL sensitivity and high specificity compared to standard blood cultures and the Widal test, validated clinically at MAMC Hospital, New Delhi.

- Reduced the total diagnostic time from 2–5 days to ~5 hours, with iAST enabling antimicrobial susceptibility classification (Resistant, Intermediate, Susceptible) in 2 hours.

- The work has received national visibility and was featured in several [leading newspapers](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/our-cost-effective-test-will-help-detect-typhoid-in-just-7-hours/article17463792.ece).
