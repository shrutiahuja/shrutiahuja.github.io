Supervised a Master's student from VIT Vellore on **developing a nucleic-acid lateral flow assay (NALF) for rapid detection of urinary tract infection (UTI).**

I conceptualized and designed the entire project workflow — from assay design to prototype fabrication. The dissertation included training the intern in Autodesk Fusion 360, laser cutting, assembling and packaging lateral flow strips, bacterial subculturing, genomic DNA isolation techniques, PCR, and agarose gel electrophoresis. 

- The project involved designing a simple lateral flow strip with a nitrocellulose (test) pad and adsorbent pad. The NALF strip was assembled and laminated through a sandwich method utilizing 3M tapes and PET sheets.
- Conjugated gold nanoparticles with thiol modified oligonucleotides using salt aging.
- Immobilization of capture probe on nitrocellulose pad using UV-irradiation that induced covalent bonding.
- Tested the utility of the NALF strip using *E.coli* spiked urine diluent.
