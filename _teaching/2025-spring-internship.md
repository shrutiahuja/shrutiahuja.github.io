Supervised summer interns on **Optimizing bacterial capture and DNA isolation from wastewater samples using paper dipsticks**

- Trained undergraduate interns in wastewater collection and handling (as per CDC guidelines), genomic nucleic acid isolation, plasmid transformation, standard curve preparation, real-time qPCR, bacterial sub-culturing, and agarose gel electrophoresis.

- Following the internship, **one of the trainees secured the Wadhwani Research Centre for Bioengineering (WRCB) internship** at IIT Bombay, where she is now applying these techniques to pathogen detection from soil samples.
